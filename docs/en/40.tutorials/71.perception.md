## Sample Introduction

MSDK perception module can realize the perception management. The perception module provides overall switch, sub switches of specified direction(upward, downward, horizontal direction), ability of vision positioning and ability of percision landing. And perception module can change the type of obstacle avoidance, the braking distance of specified direction and the warining distance of specified direction. Through the perception module, developers can start the adaptation, expansion and maintenance of perception function more easily. 


## Interface Calling Process

For detailed usage, please refer to perception management class [IPerceptionManager]() of MSDK API documentaiton.

> **Notice:**
> * If the overall switch turns on, the sub switches turn on. If the overall switch turns off, the sub switches turn off.
> * If the overall switch is off, the sub switches can not be turned on. If the sub switches is off, the overall switch will be turned off. 
> * For M300 RTK and M30 Series, the `setObstacleAvoidanceType()` only supports `BRAKE`.
> * In the process diagram, the interface  called and the calling order of the interface is only for reference, please check the sample code for details.
